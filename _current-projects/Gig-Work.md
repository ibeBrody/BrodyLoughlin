This panel discussion will attempt to depict how the present-day workforce will transition to a non-existent workforce through periods of change in which the ingratiation acceptance and increased development of the gig economy will be the mechanism that bridges the gap between the current workforce and the non-existent one. Many people question what jobs are included in the gig economy, and many deny the possibility of the gig economy persisting in the long term. However, research shows that the gig economy is becoming increasingly available and desired all over the world and has grown 50% in the past decade. In this panel discussion, the types of gig work, the history and current demographics of the gig economy, and the future of the gig economy may be discussed. The ultimate goal of this panel discussion will be to use found evidence and well-thought predictions with assistance from the previously mentioned subtopics to explain how gig work will be the key factor in altering how work is normally performed and ultimately pave the way in being the beginning of the end of paid employment.
