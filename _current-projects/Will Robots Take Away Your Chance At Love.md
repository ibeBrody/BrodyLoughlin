# Will Robots Take Away Your Chance At Love?
## Pitch 3.0
### New Instructions
1. Add 5 specific topics to each pitch (work together on 3C), each of which could be the topic on which you ask a collaborator to speak (in other words, don't just state the same thing five different ways — each topic should be adequately distinct that it could warrant a collaborator's participation to cover).
2. Through organic means, explore resources to see who works in these spaces. Record contact information and why you think someone works in the given space(s), and note the space(s), perhaps in a Google Sheet. As you explore people and their collaborators, note extra topics beyond the 5 that you created and add them to the pitch document.
3. Modify the pitch document by
	1. Rewording the topics to fit with what you learned from (2)
	2. Rewording the whole session, if it comes to that, to fit the things that you learned from (2) and the reflections that you've had
	3. Adding the names of potential/target collaborators to each topic statement as appropriate.

### New Pitch
This panel discussion will attempt to open the discourse around a future of work where paid employment is absent and where people are more isolated than ever before. As the recent COVID-19 pandemic shows, the loss of jobs can be sudden and widespread.

#### May not need to send it to other people
Research has shown that a relationship between loneliness and unemployment is present, and the individuals who suffer loneliness are more likely to be unemployed. Causality in this relationship is relatively under-researched. However, there is causal research demonstrating a bi-directional relationship between these outcomes — that job loss leads to loneliness, and that feeling loneliness contributes to further unemployment.

#### 5 Topics
- One possible topic within this panel discussion will be that individuals are more willing to disclose information to computers rather than humans and how the automation of active listening may be a possible solution to this isolation problem.
- Will engaging in conversation with an AI be sufficient in replacing the human interaction otherwise gained from paid work.



1. How to predict who will and who won't flounder without paid work.  
2. What systems to put into place to help folks transition from paid employment to non-employment (in terms of isolation &c.)  
3. Substitutes for the social value of paid work.
4. What the Pandemic taught us about this topic.
5. What role could AI play in a future of non-employment

## Pitch 2.0
Ideas - (Will Robots Take Away Your Chance At Love?) - `Measuring love or connection, they probably are different` - is a cool title and heavy into the future
- Maybe try and focus on the idea of “loving” a robot
	- I am no longer going to work and seeing that cute coworker (JIM & PAM), in fact, I am no longer seeing anyone. I have no need to go out of my house since everything is automated. Is this new robot that will actively listen to me (i.e. be able to respond and conversate) be enough to replace the social connection that I had when I was working?
		- `but how is this I-O`  
			- Could tie this into remote work and the idea of the loss of physical connection with people? `but the robot won't have a physical connection would it?` maybe just whatever connection, if any, we get from “being around” people.
				- The main focus would be on the future but by connecting remote work and the possible downside of losing this “connection” we get both remote work people and the future of work people?
- Ditch the employee engagement side of it, and focus more on the connection side?
	- Since this is a Panel discussion, I don’t think/know if I should focus so heavily on a robot that listens as a solution, but rather try and incorporate various ideas to replace this connection, (i.e. family-work, support from the employer, leisure activities, sleep as a buffer?, technology, work design?`no need to design a job in a future of no jobs`.
		- I think this is important, or is it
- Look up past siop proposals to see if a connection is something that comes up
	- If so then look up possible collaborators		
- Possible questions for Panel Discussion
	- How can we use this to relate to remote work? `probably bad since they are going because it is about remote work`, `but how is remote work connected to the future of no work?`
	- How can we use research from family work to offer a solution to this possible problem? `If I am asking questions directed at each sub-area then how is this different from an ignite`

- Another thing to look for is the idea that people are more honest in therapy sessions when they believe they are confessing their troubles to a computer because a machine cant pass moral judgment.
	- For example
		- Google and WebMD
- School nowadays are mainly used to teach people how to work, but in the future should school instead focus on something else like how to spend their time, hobbies, etc
## Notes

This panel discussion will attempt to open the discourse around a future of work where paid employment is absent and where people are more isolated than ever before. As the recent COVID-19 pandemic shows, the loss of jobs can be both sudden and widespread. Research has shown that a relationship between loneliness and unemployment is present and the individuals who suffer loneliness are more likely to be unemployed. Causality in this relationship is relatively under-researched. However, there is causal research demonstrating a bi-directional relationship between these outcomes — that job loss leads to loneliness, and that feeling loneliness contributes to further unemployment. One possible topic within this panel discussion will be centered around the idea of individuals being more willing to disclose information to computers rather than humans, and how the automation of active listening may be a possible solution to this isolation problem.

## Pitch

Pitch for 3E: Will Robots Take Away Your Chance At Love?
- panel discussion about *listening*
	- different viewpoints
		- Work engagement
		- Innovation
			- Creativity

This will be a panel discussion that will present research-grounded advice to supervisory level SIOP members about the benefits of listening in the workplace. Topics will include work engagement, emotional exhaustion, turnover intention, organizational citizenship behavior, and creativity. Rough questions to be asked include:

- What is the current view on listening in the workplace?
- What does the research suggest are the benefits of promoting supervisory listening?
- What strategies can be implemented to increase perceived listening?
- What is the current research around vulnerable or minority populations and their perception of being heard?

The reason that this proposal is important to the future of work is that as more and more automation gets implemented into the workplace, employees may become an afterthought and this effect could worsen as the need for paid employment diminishes. The ability to increase perceived listening by employees may help to still have the engagement of the employees in a future of no paid employment.

### Notes
Unemployed people should have the most time to socialize but are frequently the ones who feel the most isolated -  [[Morrish2021]]


People are more open to computers than their therapists - [[Lucas2014]]

### Notes from Dr. Ternes

When we develop hypotheses, we do not typically see the writing of both H1 and H0. Instead, hypothesis 1 is simply, when paired with a nonhuman agent, active-empathic listening will be sufficient to replace human interaction. In your case, you mentioned the need for three levels of your IV. This likely means that you will have multiple hypotheses. Your outcome variable (which should be indicated by the wording of your hypotheses) would show differences in the human and non-human scripted groups. It also would show differences in the non-human scripted and human unscripted groups. Thus, you need a minimum of two hypotheses. Likely, a third (and probably primary) hypothesis is that the non-human scripted agent has a higher mean than the combined groups of human scripted and human non-scripted

### Clips from paper

Jonsdottir (2020) defines work engagement as a “positive, fulfilling, and emotional state of mind associated with work.” Workplace social support is another significant construct that refers to employees' interactions and relationships with supervisors and coworkers. There is a significant positive relationship between active-empathetic listening and employee engagement. Workers who regarded their superiors as active-empathetic listeners scored substantially better on dedication than employees who perceived their supervisors as low-scoring active-empathetic listeners. (Jonsdottir & Kristinsson, 2020) Individuals in romantic relationships when the partner is not very supportive and who are unsatisfied with their relationship are likely to report significant feelings of loneliness, according to some data (De Jong Gierveld, Broese van Groenou, Hoogendoorn, & Smit, 2009; Hawkley et al., 2008)
