This panel discussion will attempt to open the discourse around a future of work where paid employment is absent and where people are more isolated than ever before. As the recent COVID-19 pandemic shows, the loss of jobs can be sudden and widespread. 

1. How to determine who will and will not struggle in the absence of paid work. 
2. What systems could be put in place to assist people in transitioning from paid employment to non-employment? (in terms of isolation &c.) 
3. What could be some substitutes for the social value of paid work? (teams)
4. What has the pandemic taught us about the impact technology has already had on humans?
5. What role could AI play in a future of non-employment?
