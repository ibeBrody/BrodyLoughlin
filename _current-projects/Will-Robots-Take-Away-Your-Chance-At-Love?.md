Current Team [Dr. Steven Toaddy (affectionately known as ./)](https://works.bepress.com/steven-toaddy/about/), [Kevin Sullivan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevin-sullivan-78792a180/), and me (Brody)

The session will be a panel discussion aimed at the future of work, more specifically and explicitly the potential future in which automation (broadly construed) completely eliminates the need and, indeed, the possibility for paid human employment. Some of the questions I would like to address in this panel are:

1. How to determine who will and will not flounder in the absence of paid work?
2. What systems could be implemented to assist individuals transitioning from paid employment to non-employment with a focus on well-being?
3. Substitutes for the social value gained from paid work?
4. What has the recent pandemic taught us about the impact technology has on well-being and relationships?
5. How could relationships be affected in a future without work?
#### Additional topics dependent on outside interests
1. The place AI may have in relation to well-being in this described future. 
2. Automating coping.
3. Is there a risk of feeling isolated without work?
