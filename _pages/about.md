I have a bachelor's of science in Psychology from the University of Arizona. I am currently a doctoral student studying Industrial-Organizational Psychology at Louisiana Tech University. 

I am interested in collaborating on future research projects covering: the future of work, automation, changing workforce, employee well-being, human/tech interactions, work-related sleep, and work-family issues involving vulnerable and minority populations.
