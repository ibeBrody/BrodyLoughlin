I graduated from the University of Arizona with a bachelor's degree in psychology. I am currently a doctoral student at Louisiana Tech University studying Industrial-Organizational Psychology. 

I am interested in collaborating on future research projects addressing the following topics: the future of work, automation, the changing workforce, employee well-being, human/tech interactions, job-related sleep, and work-family difficulties, including vulnerable and minority groups.
